# ORE Roadmap

Short notes on version intent. Not a feature backlog.

---

**v0.2** — Temporal continuity without cognitive continuity. The user can run many turns in one process (interactive REPL), but each turn is isolated; there is no conversation memory or shared context.

**v0.2.1** — Semantics lock: “interactive” is explicitly defined as non-conversational (no memory, no accumulation, no hidden context). Documentation only.
